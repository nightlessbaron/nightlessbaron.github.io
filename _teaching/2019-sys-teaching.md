I was a teaching assistant for the Signals & Systems Course offered by Department of ECE in Fall'19. The course was taught by [Dr. Ankit Bhurane](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=8pDdSIsAAAAJ&hl=en), who was the HoD of ECE Department at that time. The duration of the course was 3 months, from 5<sup>th</sup> Aug 2019 - 04<sup>th</sup> Dec 2019.

My duties were not limited to only clearing doubts, organizing tutorial sessions, but also included setting practice question banks, and helping the professor with setting quiz questions. I also helped a fellow TA to made notes on IIR Filters. You can check them [here](/files/IIR_Filter.pdf). You may also want to check out the lecture series on Signals & Systems by Dr. Ankit Bhurane on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9omMCApA_HWd0QrSTlC7AFtRbilBIOeN) and have an [overview](/files/teaching/Course_Overview.pdf) of the course.

If you are interested in solving a few problems based on the topics covered in the lecture, do have a look at the [question bank](/files/teaching/Signals_and_Systems_Question_Bank.zip) we made. As usual, if you want to know regarding anything else, drop a message below ðŸ˜‡.
