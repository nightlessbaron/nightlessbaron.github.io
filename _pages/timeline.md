2021
-----
1. I completed a significant part of my journey this May. I successfully defended my undergraduate thesis and completed by Bachelors at IIIT Nagpur. 
2. I will be working with [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd) and Dr. Arjun Magge on my undergraduate thesis. I will be working on **Geolocating the home addresses of Twitter Users.** A fun and exciting project, can't wait to work on it!
3. I am excited to announce that our journal paper **"Digital Image Noise Estimation using DWT Coefficients"** has been published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, a top tier journal in Image Processing.\
DOI: [10.1109/TIP.2021.3049961](10.1109/TIP.2021.3049961) &emsp; &emsp; Impact Factor: **9.340**
4. I will be a part of the reviewing committee for the SMM4H Workshop under the banner of NAACL-HLT 2021. This is my first time doing it, I am nervous & excited. Hands crossed :)
5. I participated in 3 shared tasks at [SMM4H Workshop](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h-2021/), and it was fun! We were ranked in top performing teams in 2 out of the 3 shared tasks. We published our findings at the SMM4H Workshop under the banner of NAACL-HLT Conference.\

2020
-----
1. We participated in WNUT'20 shared task, and ranked 13th (accuracy-wise) all over the world! We published our methodology and findings in Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2020).\
DOI: [10.18653/v1/2020.wnut-1.52](10.18653/v1/2020.wnut-1.52) &emsp; Article Link : [https://aclanthology.org/2020.wnut-1.52/](https://aclanthology.org/2020.wnut-1.52/)
2. I will be joining as a research intern at **[HLP Lab](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/), University of Pennsylvania** under the supervision of [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd) from July 2020 to September 2020. I will be mostly working on Social Media Mining project, which involves building natural language processing systems to automatically extract information from social media timelines.
3. I am soon starting my research at **TCS Research & Innovation Labs, Mumbai** under the mentorship of Principal Research Scientist [Dr. Rekha Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rekha-singhal-7122635/) from May 2020 to December 2020. My work there will be mostly related to designing efficient deep learning architectures, improving frameworks and finally making them deployment ready.
4. I am glad to announce that our journal paper **"Automated phase classification in cyclic alternating patterns in sleep stages using Wigner-Ville Distribution based features"** has been published in Computers in Biology and Medicine 2020.\
DOI: [10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103691](10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103691).&emsp;&emsp; Impact Factor: **2.286**
5. Finally the paper **"Digital Image Noise Estimation using DWT Coefficients"** has been submitted in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. Special thanks to Dr. Vipin Kamble for making this possible and for guiding me for the past 6 months.

2019
-----
1. Our conference paper **"Early Stage Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using Correlation Coefficients and Haar Transform"** , has been accepted for the International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks, 2019.  
2. I was a teaching assistant for the course **"Signals and Systems"**, taught by Dr. Ankit Bhurane. I was mainly involved in clearing doubts of students, setting questions as well as guiding them for their course projects. 
3. I was a research intern under the supervision of [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/) at IITGN where I worked on Voting Aspects in Computational Social Science. More details can be found out [here](/cv). I was also a teaching assistant at **ACM-W Summer School on Game Theory** during my stay. 

2018
-----
1. I interned in winter as a research intern at IIT Gandhinagar under the mentorship of [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/). I was introduced to the vast field of Algorithmic Game Theory during my stay of 2 months.  Here are some of my notes : [Fair Division](files/Lecture_Series_on_Fair_Division.pdf), [Voting Theory](files/Lecture_Series_on_Computational_Social_Choice.pdf). You can also find these lecture series particularly intriguing: Rohit Vaish's [Lecture Series on Fair Division](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfu94TCePTvFBCeRqWLC_jEwEZhY4PLw), Edith Elkind's [Lecture Series on COMSOC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfu94TCePTtAgBZ36AAJ6dibrZb001yR) and Piotr Faliszewskli's [Intro to COMSOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcnQ4p_6BFc&ab_channel=ParameterizedComplexity). I also attended the FSTTCS  Dec'2019 conference at Ahmedabad, India which was an overall amazing eye-opener experience for me.
2. Helped in building a basic but robust and fast website for [SQMS INDIA](https://sqmsindia.com/) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks.
